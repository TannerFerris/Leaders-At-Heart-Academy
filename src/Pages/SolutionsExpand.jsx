        <PageTemplate text='Our program is designed for flexibility, meaning students can join the dual-language track 
        at any grade level. Whether starting in kindergarten or entering in 3rd, 6th, or 9th grade, all students seamlessly 
        integrate into the program. For example, a 3rd-grade student arriving from Mexico, fluent in Spanish, will have their 
        Spanish language skills strengthened while they acquire English proficiency. Similarly, a native English speaker joining 
        at the same grade will immerse themselves in Spanish while building literacy in both languages.'/>
