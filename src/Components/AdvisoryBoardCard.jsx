                    <h2>Coach Heckathorn has dedicated 49 years to the field of education, building an exceptional career as 
                      both a teacher and an administrator. A lifelong advocate for learning and student success, Norman holds 
                      a Bachelor’s Degree from East Texas University (1967) and a Master’s Degree from Prairie View A&M University (1981).
                      Coach’s passion for education is deeply rooted in his family. His wife served as an educational secretary for 26 years, 
                      and all four of his children have followed in his footsteps as educators.
                      <br/><br/>
                      Throughout his career, Coach has gained a wealth of experience across various roles, including teacher, coach, athletic 
                      director, and administrator. He has worked in school districts ranging from 1A to 5A, giving him a broad perspective on 
                      the challenges and opportunities within diverse educational settings. Whether leading small teams as an Athletic Director 
                      with just two staff members or managing larger programs with 24 staff members, Norman has consistently demonstrated 
                      strong leadership and a commitment to excellence.
                      In addition to his extensive leadership experience, Coach has a strong background in teaching social studies and history, 
                      equipping him with an understanding of the academic and social needs of students.
                      <br/><br/>
                      Now retired, Coach remains passionate about creating environments where both educators and students can thrive. His 
                      decades of experience position him as a valuable advocate for innovative educational initiatives, including charter 
                      schools. Coach’s dedication to fostering student success and supporting educators continues to guide his commitment 
                      to making a lasting impact in the field of education.
