          <h1>Chad Newsom, Board President</h1>
          <h2>
            Chad Newsom graduated from Ennis High School in 1991 before
            attending Navarro Junior College in Corsicana for two years. Seeking
            to further his education, he transferred to the University of Texas
            at Austin, where he spent four years in general studies before
            discovering his passion for education in the second half of his
            senior year. Two years later, he earned a Bachelor of Science in
            Applied Learning and Development with a double minor in Life and
            Earth Science. After obtaining his Texas Teaching Certificate, he
            began his teaching career in Taylor, Texas, where he taught
            5th-grade Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, and Health,
            co-teaching alongside a bilingual reading teacher. During his four
            years in Taylor ISD, he served under two principals, four assistant
            principals, and two superintendents, eventually becoming Lead Team
            Teacher in his final year.
            <br />
            <br />
            Looking for new opportunities, Chad transitioned to Leander ISD,
            where he taught 5th-grade Mathematics for two years. It was during
            this time that he met his future wife, a Special Education teacher.
            After getting married, they moved to Palmer, Texas, where she
            accepted a position in Waxahachie ISD, and Chad took a 4th-grade
            Reading position in Ennis ISD. He later transitioned to teaching
            5th-grade Reading and Language Arts, spending a total of two years
            in Ennis ISD.
            <br />
            <br />
            In March 2006, following the birth of their first daughter, Chad
            decided to pursue a new career path and joined Commercial State
            Bank. He began working in the Loan Underwriting Department, where he
            quickly made an impact by suggesting and implementing updates to the
            bank's information technology structure. His contributions led to
            his promotion as Information Technology Coordinator. From there, he
            progressed through various leadership roles, serving as Loan
            Officer, Vice President, Executive Vice President, and ultimately
            becoming the President of Commercial State Bank. He now serves as
            the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and is a trustee of a
            trust that owns stock in the bank.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond his work in banking, Chad is deeply involved in his
            community, serving on both the Palmer Economic Committee and the
            Ferris Economic Committee. His wife currently works in the +18
            Program in Waxahachie ISD. Their oldest daughter is a freshman at
            the University of Arkansas, while their youngest is a sophomore at
            Waxahachie High School. The Newsom family's home is filled with
            love, and animals, including four cats, five dogs, four horses,
            fifteen sheep, five chickens, and one llama. In his free time, Chad
            enjoys cooking, hunting, fishing, and spending time outdoors.
